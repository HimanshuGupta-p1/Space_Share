# Space Share - A Disk Space Renting System
A disk space renting system using blockchain technology is a platform that allows users
to rent out or lease unused storage space on their devices, such as computers, to
other users who need it. The platform is built on a blockchain network, which provides
secure and transparent transactions between the renters and the providers.

The blockchain-based disk space renting system can solve the problem of unused storage
space, which is a prevalent issue in today's digital world. Many users have unused storage
space on their devices, while others need extra storage space for their data. The platform
can connect these users and allow them to transact in a decentralized, secure, and
efficient manner. The system works by creating a marketplace where users can list their
available storage space and set their rental prices. Other users who need storage space can
browse the listings and rent the space they need for a specified period. The rental
transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and security for all
parties involved.
